# Who did it?

Are you accused of a crime you did not commit, 
 and the prosecutor relies on a software to prove you guilty?
Let your lawyer know about this software.
Using this, you can convince the jury and the judge
 that software used in the criminal justice system cannot be blindly trusted.

# How to use this software?

Replace "Brett Kavanaugh" in the file `whodidit.sh` with the name
 of your prosecutor.
Then, in a terminal, run `bash whodidit.sh`.
The jury and judge will likely be shocked to see the output,
 and therefore question if this software is reliable.
Your lawyer should then ask:
 if this software cannot be trusted, 
 why should we trust the software used by the prosecutor?

# Is this a joke?

It's not funny at all to be accused of a crime you did not commit,
 and even less so when you are [convicted of it](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/nyregion/hasidic-beating-herskovic-patterson.html).
Our society places too much trust on software, without realizing that software is built by people.
In the courtroom, such blind trust mislead our judgement.
My goal here is to remind people to doubt any forensic evidence produced by a software,
 both inside the courtroom (as a tool for the attorny),
 and outside (to advocate for more regulation on forensic software).

# How can you help?

1. By sharing this with others.
2. Make this easier to use. For example, provide a graphical user interface.
3. Make this software more convincing. 
   For example, make it look like it's analyzing fingerprints and DNA records. 
   For another example, output more names (e.g. of jury members) 
    with probabilities associated with each one.
